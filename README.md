*DESCRIPTION* :

THIS JUPYTER NOTEBOOK PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE OPTIMIZATION MODEL FOR SOLVING A BUSINESS PRODUCTION PLANNING PROBLEM USING LINEAR PROGRAMMING WITH THE PULP LIBRARY IN PYTHON. THE SCENARIO INVOLVES A FURNITURE MANUFACTURING COMPANY PRODUCING TWO PRODUCTS: CHAIRS AND TABLES, AIMING TO MAXIMIZE DAILY PROFIT UNDER RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. EACH CHAIR REQUIRES 2 HOURS OF LABOR AND 4 UNITS OF WOOD, YIELDING $8 PROFIT, WHILE EACH TABLE NEEDS 3 HOURS OF LABOR AND 6 UNITS OF WOOD FOR $12 PROFIT. AVAILABLE RESOURCES ARE LIMITED TO 120 LABOR HOURS AND 180 WOOD UNITS PER DAY, WITH NON-NEGATIVITY ENSURING NO NEGATIVE PRODUCTION QUANTITIES. THE MODEL IS FORMULATED AS A LINEAR PROGRAMMING PROBLEM TO OPTIMIZE THE NUMBER OF CHAIRS AND TABLES PRODUCED. IN THE FIRST CELL, LIBRARIES LIKE PULP AND PANDAS ARE IMPORTED FOR MODELING AND DATA HANDLING. THE SECOND CELL DEFINES THE PROBLEM OBJECTIVE TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT (8CHAIRS + 12TABLES) AND ADDS CONSTRAINTS FOR LABOR (2CHAIRS + 3TABLES ≤ 120) AND WOOD (4CHAIRS + 6TABLES ≤ 180), USING INTEGER VARIABLES FOR WHOLE UNITS. THE PROBLEM FORMULATION IS PRINTED FOR VERIFICATION. THE THIRD CELL SOLVES THE MODEL USING PULP'S DEFAULT CBC SOLVER, OUTPUTTING THE OPTIMAL STATUS, PRODUCTION QUANTITIES (30 CHAIRS AND 20 TABLES), TOTAL PROFIT ($360), AND SHADOW PRICES (LABOR: $2 PER EXTRA HOUR; WOOD: $0). THE FOURTH CELL CONDUCTS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, CALCULATING SLACK VALUES (LABOR: 0 HOURS UNUSED; WOOD: 60 UNITS UNUSED) AND PRESENTING A SUMMARY TABLE VIA PANDAS. KEY INSIGHTS HIGHLIGHT LABOR AS THE BINDING CONSTRAINT, SUGGESTING FOCUS ON LABOR EFFICIENCY LIKE OVERTIME OR AUTOMATION, WHILE EXCESS WOOD INDICATES NO NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPLY. BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS EMPHASIZE PRIORITIZING LABOR OPTIMIZATION AND RE-RUNNING THE MODEL FOR SCENARIO CHANGES. THE FIFTH CELL INCLUDES AN OPTIONAL VISUALIZATION USING MATPLOTLIB AND NUMPY, PLOTTING THE FEASIBLE REGION BOUNDED BY CONSTRAINT LINES, WITH THE OPTIMAL POINT MARKED, AND REITERATING THE PROFIT VALUE. THIS NOTEBOOK DEMONSTRATES A SCALABLE APPROACH FOR REAL-WORLD BUSINESS DECISIONS, FROM SETUP TO SOLUTION AND INSIGHTS, REQUIRING ONLY PULP INSTALLATION TO RUN. IT SERVES AS A DELIVERABLE FOR OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES, SHOWCASING HOW LINEAR PROGRAMMING DRIVES PROFIT MAXIMIZATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN MANUFACTURING. THE CODE IS SELF-CONTAINED, WITH INLINE DATA AND PRINTED OUTPUTS SIMULATING EXECUTION RESULTS, MAKING IT EASY TO ADAPT FOR OTHER PROBLEMS LIKE TRANSPORTATION OR INTEGER PROGRAMMING.
